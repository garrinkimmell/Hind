To build, you need the latest smt-lib package from github installed:
https://github.com/tomahawkins/smt-lib.

This has been tested with the latest Linux version of z3, which you can download
at the bottom of
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/projects/z3/download.html


To run, execute "hind <smt-cmd> <file>

For example, assuming that you have z3 installed in your path on a machine named
'host',

> hind  "ssh host z3 -si -smt2 MODEL=true" two_counters.smt2

Will check the property defined in the transition system in the file found
at two_counters.smt2. The SMT solver will run on the named host. If you
have the solver installed locally, you can forgo the 'ssh host' bit.

The solver requires that the transition system must have a macro named 'trans'.
